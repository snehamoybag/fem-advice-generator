## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM naming convention
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Advice Slip API
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Before taking on this challenge I had no Idea what asynchronous programing was as I've never worked with API ever.
Hence, I had to lookup some MDN docs and had to watch some Fetch API tutorials on Youtube.
Fair to say I was a little confused about the asynchronous behavior of Javascript at first.
Therefor, I had to spend about 3 days Learning - javascript call backs, promises and async/await, fetch API and how to write custom Header(s) for some APIs.
Had plenty of fun tryingout different APIs to do fun stuffs!

This challenge definitly helped me upscale and improve my knowledge about javascript.

### Continued development

The app is very barebones/basic, it generates a new Advice on a button click. Which it supposed to do!
But in near future I'd like to add some loading animation in between the data fetching interval.
Also fix a bug where, if you tap the button continuously, it does some weired stufs..like flickering!
